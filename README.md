Update

I'm still finding a way to protect the endpoints from the lambda, i've tried cognito + jwt authorizer but i'm confused in how to obtain the token and use it. I tried [this](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-secure-api-gateway-http-endpoints-with-jwt-authorizer/) but I got half way there

I'll try another thing in the following days
